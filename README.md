# Neighbourhood Map
Find store, cafe, food and bar in different cities and countries and see which one you have not visited yet or plan your future visits. You can click on the markers and see the useful info about every places.

In my project I have chosen Google Map Api. It's one page app that uses knockout.js binding.
